Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

## What will you find here?

By studying the Vuex documentation and the suggested Scrimba videos, you only have to put these lessons into practice to consolidate the knowledge acquired. This will also serve as a guide when you need to refresh your knowledge.

Here you will find the 10 exercises (solved) that are described in the official [Vuex](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/) documentation.

## How is it segmented?

1. In `scaffolding` branch or `v0-scaffolding` tag: Scaffolding to start almost from scratch each exercise.
2. In `option-api` branch or `v1-option-api` tag: Exercises solved implementing the Options API.
3. In `composition-api` branch or `v2-composition-api` tag: Exercises solved implementing the Composition API.
4. In `script-setup` branch or `v3-script-setup` tag: Exercises solved implementing the Composition API with `<script setup>`.
